Data Splitting and Preprocessing

Data cleaning
After observing the data manually, I discovered that the data was consistent to an appreciable level. There was no missing data in a cell, and no missing rows that needed cleaning. I also checked if data was duplicated in the dataset but no Data duplicate was discovered. And no white space found meaning the dataset was consistent.
I now Split the data into category 1 which is independent values and category 2 dependent values.

In analysis insight
June 2023 is the highest sales month in the year. The company need to check out what made this month of June more resourceful than other months and then replicate same in the other months  
Ches Bonnell being the highest sales person needs to be asked about techniques used for achieving this.
Highest boxes shipped by salesperson is Karen McCaffey  who shipped 9658 in all and the follow up sales person is Beverie Moffet while the least is Brien Boise with 8102 shipped.
The products between 1000 - 2999 has the highest counts of sales of 229, this means that the customers are buying products within this range more than the other products or brands of chocolate. My recommendation in this wise is that these brands of chocolate should not be out of stock so as encourage more of the patronage. Also areas that are not doing well in sale should be supplied these brands of chocolates and techniques used in the areas doing well should be replicated.

Final Recommendation
I recommend that this sales person trains the others with the technique used to achieve this record so as to make others do same. The highest sales person should also be transferred to areas that are not doing well to replicate his expertise for better sales. A dimension of reward should be introduced so as to encourage other sales personnel. However, this sales person also had months where he did not really perform well, so he also needs to be encouraged to always replicate the techques used in other months where he did not do well.
Those sales personnel that are making things work here in Australia should be transferred to the other countries that are not doing well to replicate their expertise.
